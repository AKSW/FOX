   Shortly after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fossett</ENAMEX>'s launching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> his competitors sent
him telegrams of congratulation.
<p>
   The British balloon, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgin</ENAMEX> Global Challenger, is to
be flown by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Branson</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgin Atlantic Airways</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Per Lindstrand</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindstrand Balloons Ltd.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oswestry</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>, and an Irish balloonist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rory McCarthy</ENAMEX>.
<p>


<p>
   Since the first manned balloon flight in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Francois
Pilatre de Rozier</ENAMEX> and the Marquis <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois Laurent d'Arlandes</ENAMEX> in a
Montgolfier hot-air balloon, many balloonists have attempted
round-the-world flights, but all have failed, and some have died
trying.
<p>
   Five unsuccessful attempts were made by a single team led by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Newman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scottsdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earthwinds</ENAMEX> balloon before
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newman</ENAMEX> abandoned his efforts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The Rozier balloon is named after its inventor, who was forced
to use inflammable hydrogen in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> version, since a
century was to pass before the discovery of nonflammable helium.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rozier</ENAMEX> was killed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785</TIMEX> while trying to cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English
Channel</ENAMEX>; his hydrogen-and-hot-air hybrid balloon caught fire and
crashed.
<p>
   From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>, balloonists relied almost exclusively
on hydrogen or helium for lift, since hot-air burners were regarded
as too dangerous.
